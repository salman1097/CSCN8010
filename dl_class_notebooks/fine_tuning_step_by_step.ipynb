    "1. we will work with the 3 classes with the highest number of images. Identify those classes, and use only these for the next steps. You can delete/discard the others.\n",
    "2. Use data-augmentation to increase the number of training images. You are encouraged to try out various augmentation methods supported by Keras. The rule of thumb is that as long as an augmentation produces realistic images - it is probably a good idea to add it.(2 point)\n",
    "2. Fine-Tune VGG16 (pre-trained on imagenet), to classify the 3 classes (2 points)\n",
    "3. Explore the model performance: accuracy, confusion metric, precision, recall, F1-score, precision-recall curve and its area under the curve (AUC). Explore specific examples in which the model failed to predict correctly. (2 points)"
